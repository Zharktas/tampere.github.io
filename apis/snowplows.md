The Snowplow API can be used to access the current and past locations of snowplows as well as the task they were assigned at that moment. The API can be accessed [HERE](https://kunto.softroi.fi/KuntoTampere/v1/snowplow/).

A sample visualization source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tampere/Aurat).
