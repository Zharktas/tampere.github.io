Linked Events provides categorized data on events. 

Linked Events is an attempt to harmonize city event data APIs across Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Turku, Tampere and Oulu. 
The API contains event data from the Visit Tampere API.
The api backend source code can be found on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/tampere/linked-events).
